# About This Repo

This repo is only a test for slate theme for Jekyll for Github Pages.

Specifically this is created for [pull request #3](https://github.com/pages-themes/slate/pull/3) "Fix image overflow when media screen is smaller than 980px" on Github. Since this fix is long time ago (2017), I'm not sure it is still valid or not.
